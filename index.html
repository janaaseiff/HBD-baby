    <p>Happy birthday Baby!</p>

    <p>Today is a special day, not just because it's your birthday, but because the world was blessed with someone as beautiful, strong, and special as you. I want you to know that even if things aren't perfect right now, your life means so much to me and to everyone around you. You are truly one of a kind, and I thank Allah every day for bringing you into my life. Also I want you to know how much you are loved. You've filled my life with so much joy & happiness I'm so grateful to have you by my side & to be able to call you mine. You make all my days so much brighter & happier to be loved by someone like you. You're the only person I could never get tired of talking to & the only I think about all day. You are the only one who can make me smile with just a look. I can't explain how much you mean to me.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you. Or really I can't ever imagine a single second without you. I always wanted to make you safe, proud and comfortable about me. I want you to make sure that you can come to me whenever you need. I am always here for you. It has been 4 years now together, can you imagineee!! Just you have all my heart, you're the one I wanna be making love, friends, family etc.</p>

    <p>I love you so much, and I mean that from the deepest part of my heart. No matter what life brings, I'll always be here to support you, to care for you, and to walk this journey with you. You are not alone, and you'll never be alone. I'm with you, always.</p>

    <p>My prayer for you today is that Allah blesses you with peace, joy, and strength to overcome every challenge. May He open doors that no one can shut, and may your heart be filled with hope, happiness, and love not just today, but always.</p>

    <p>Please don't ever forget how special you are. You're a light, even when you don't feel it. You inspire more than you know, and I believe in you endlessly.</p>

    <p>Enjoy your day, my King. You deserve all the best and more.💋💞</p>

  <h2> Our Future Plans 💍👩‍❤️‍👨</h2>
  <div class="future-text">
    <strong>Someday, we'll travel the world together — start with Turkey, walk through the streets of Istanbul hand in hand, and then fly to Paris to watch the sunset by the Eiffel Tower.</strong>

    <strong>We'll build our dream home — calm, cozy, and filled with laughter, a place that feels like pure peace.</strong>

    <strong>We'll decorate every corner together, choose the colors, the furniture, even the smallest details that make it ours.</strong>

    <strong>One day, we'll wake up to the sound of our kids' laughter, have breakfast together, and smile knowing that we made it, that we built a life full of love, patience, and understanding.</strong>

    <p class="final-line">And no matter how far we go or how much time passes,<br> I'll always choose you in every life, in every dream, in every tomorrow. 💞</p>
